WEB DEVELOPMENT PROJECT-1

Features I used for the pricing landing page are:-
1.Visual Elements: Use visuals strategically. Incorporate badges for 'Popular,' 'Best Value,' or 'Recommended' to direct attention to the plan that aligns with most users' needs.
2.Compelling CTAs: Craft compelling and action-oriented CTAs that specify the action users will take, such as "Start Free Trial," "Get Started," or "Upgrade Now."
3.Pricing Clarity: Avoid hidden fees. Use straightforward language and clearly define what's included in each plan. Provide a breakdown of additional costs, if any, for better transparency.
4.Free Resources or Add-ons: Consider offering free resources (e.g., ebooks, guides) or additional add-ons as part of certain plans to enhance their perceived value.
5.Flexible Payment Options: If possible, offer flexible payment options, such as monthly, yearly, or custom billing cycles, catering to different user preferences.
6.Visual Hierarchy: Make use of design elements like colors, fonts, and sizes to draw attention to the most popular or recommended plan. Use visual cues to guide users toward the preferred   option.
7.Call-to-Action (CTA): Each pricing tier should have a prominent CTA button that stands out. Use action-oriented language to encourage users to select a plan or sign up.
8.Transparency and Clarity: Be transparent about what each plan includes and excludes. Avoid jargon and provide explanations where necessary to avoid confusion.
